# Tic Tac Toe

Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid. The winner is the first to get three marks in a row, or draw when all nine spaces are filled
It is convention that the 'X' plays first.

## Functional Requirements

*Step 1*
Create a walking skeleton for the game of tic-tac-toe, that includes the following:

- [ ] A new repository that is checked into version control and accessible to the mentoring team.
- [ ] Any relevant packages are managed by a package manager rather than copy/pasted into the repo.
- [ ] A single passing test (this might be a dummy test that asserts true equals true).
- [ ] A detailed README outlining how to run the app and tests.
- [ ] A continuous integration service that runs the test suite upon every commit. One suggestion is to use GitHub and GitHub Actions.
- [ ] A simple message that is displayed on the console when the app is run (e.g. "Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe").

## Process
 
 *Step 1* - Create a walking skeleton 
 `A Walking Skeleton is a tiny implementation of the system that performs a small end-to-end function. It need not use the final architecture, but it should link together the main architectural components. The architecture and the functionality can then evolve in parallel. - Alistair Cockburn`
